### What I learned

Today, I learned something cool in web design! I figured out how to import Google Fonts into my CSS and set different font weights. It's pretty awesome!

To import a Google Font, you just need to use the @import rule in your CSS file. For instance, to import the "Outfit" font with weights 400 (normal) and 700 (bold), you'd write:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```
Then, you can use the font in your CSS like this:
```css
h5{
    font-family: 'Outfit',sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700;
}
p{
    font-family: 'Outfit',sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-size: 15px;
}
``` 


### Useful resources

- [Learn bootstrap css class](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/) - This helped me to use bootstrap. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
